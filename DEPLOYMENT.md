   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `dist`
   - **Install Command**: `npm install`

## Build Configuration

The project is configured with:
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist`
- **Node.js Version**: Latest LTS (automatically detected)

## Environment Variables

## Custom Domain (Optional)

After deployment:
1. Go to your project dashboard on Vercel
2. Navigate to "Settings" â†’ "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain
4. Configure DNS records as instructed

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Check that TypeScript compilation succeeds locally
- Verify the build command works: `npm run build`

### Asset Loading Issues
- Ensure all assets are in the `assets/` directory
- Check that file paths in your code are correct
- Verify the `vercel.json` routing configuration

### Performance Issues
- The build is optimized with code splitting for Three.js and Tween.js
- Assets are cached with appropriate headers
- Consider enabling Vercel's Edge Network for global performance

## Monitoring

After deployment, you can:
- View real-time logs in the Vercel dashboard
- Monitor performance with Vercel Analytics
- Set up alerts for build failures

## Updates

To update your deployment:
1. Push changes to your Git repository
2. Vercel will automatically trigger a new deployment
3. Preview deployments are created for pull requests
